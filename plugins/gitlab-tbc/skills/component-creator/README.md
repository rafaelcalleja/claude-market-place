# Component Creator Skill

Guide for creating production-ready to-be-continuous components following ecosystem conventions, architectural principles, and best practices.

## 🎯 What This Skill Does

This skill teaches how to create to-be-continuous GitLab CI/CD components compatible 100% with:
- ✅ to-be-continuous philosophy and architecture
- ✅ Component syntax and input specifications
- ✅ Variant patterns (standard, -vault, -oidc, -gcp, -aws, -eks, -ecr)
- ✅ Base job inheritance patterns
- ✅ Naming conventions and directory structure
- ✅ Dotenv artifact export patterns
- ✅ Adaptive pipeline strategy
- ✅ Documentation and versioning requirements

## 🚀 How to Use It

The skill activates when you ask about creating components:

### Natural Language Queries

```
"How do I create a to-be-continuous component?"
"What's the structure of a TBC component?"
"How to create a variant for authentication?"
"Show me how to define component inputs"
"What are the naming conventions for components?"
"How do base jobs work in components?"
```

### Trigger Phrases

- create to-be-continuous component
- build TBC template
- extend existing component
- create variant
- contribute to to-be-continuous
- component structure
- how to create gitlab ci component
- input specifications
- base job patterns

## 📚 What's Included

### Component Architecture
- Directory structure requirements
- YAML file organization
- Required vs optional files

### Input Specifications
- spec.inputs syntax
- Dual syntax support (inputs + variables)
- Type definitions
- Default values

### Base Job Patterns
- Hidden base job pattern
- Tool-specific base jobs
- Extensibility for users

### Variant Patterns
- When to create variants
- Standard variant patterns
- Authentication method variants
- Cross-component learning

### Best Practices
- Single responsibility principle
- Adaptive pipeline strategy
- Composability patterns
- Documentation requirements
- Versioning strategy

## 🔍 Philosophy

This skill follows **DETERMINISTIC + EDUCATIONAL** principles:

- ✅ Uses real component examples from to-be-continuous
- ✅ References catalog.md (62 components)
- ✅ References variantes.md (70+ variants)
- ✅ Shows proven patterns from production components
- ✅ Teaches to-be-continuous philosophy
- ❌ NEVER invents non-existent patterns
- ❌ NEVER suggests breaking ecosystem conventions

## 💡 Tips

- **Study existing components**: Best way to learn is by examining similar components in catalog
- **Start simple**: Begin with minimal component, add features incrementally
- **Follow naming conventions**: Consistency across ecosystem is critical
- **Test variants**: All variants must be validated before release
- **Document thoroughly**: README and CHANGELOG are required

**Remember**: This skill is for LEARNING how to create components. It teaches structure, conventions, and patterns following to-be-continuous ecosystem standards.
