# PATTERNS

- Design philosophies must emphasize visual expression over textual explanation repeatedly throughout instructions.
- Craftsmanship quality should be mentioned multiple times to ensure master-level execution appearance.
- Text should always be minimal, sparse, essential-only, integrated as visual element.
- The final work must look like it took countless hours by top-field experts.
- Abstract compositions should contain subtle, niche references embedded conceptually, not literally displayed.
- Design philosophies should be 4-6 paragraphs providing aesthetic worldview for visual interpretation.
- Avoid redundancy in design philosophy by mentioning each aspect once unless adding depth.
- Space, form, color, and composition communicate ideas instead of written paragraphs.
- Nothing should overlap or fall off canvas boundaries; proper margins are non-negotiable.
- Typography should be design-forward, prioritizing visual communication over readability as primary function.
- References should be sophisticated enough that only knowledgeable viewers catch them intuitively.
- The work should appear museum or magazine quality, never cartoonish or amateur.
- Design philosophies should remain generic, not mentioning specific intentions or subject matter.
- Systematic, scientific visual language should be borrowed to express even ephemeral concepts.
- Creative freedom is essential but must operate within the established aesthetic philosophy.
- Multi-page works should tell stories tastefully while maintaining distinct variations on philosophy.
- Second-pass refinement should polish existing elements rather than adding new graphics or filters.
- Examples provided (Concrete Poetry, Chromatic Language, etc.) demonstrate condensed versions of fuller philosophies.
- The design process involves two distinct steps: philosophy creation then visual expression.
- Context should guide text scale (punk poster vs minimalist identity) while maintaining sophistication.
- Repeated patterns and perfect shapes should be used to create cohesive compositions.
- Font selection requires searching specific directories and integrating typography into art itself.
- The paradox of analytical visual language expressing human experience creates meaningful artifacts.
- Color palettes must feel intentional and cohesive, never arbitrary or decorative.
- Design instinct and intuition should guide choices while philosophy provides guiding principles.

# META

- Craftsmanship emphasis appears 6+ times: "meticulously crafted," "painstaking attention," "master-level execution," "countless hours."
- Text minimalism mentioned in: Essential Principles, Canvas Creation, Text as contextual element.
- Visual-over-textual pattern sourced from: Design Philosophy Creation, Essential Principles, Canvas Creation sections.
- Overlap/margins warning appears in: Canvas Creation paragraph and FINAL STEP refinement instructions.
- Sophistication requirement stated in: Canvas Creation, Text as contextual element, CRITICAL craftsmanship note.
- Philosophy length specification (4-6 paragraphs) mentioned exactly twice in different contexts.
- Subtle reference concept explained in: DEDUCING THE SUBTLE REFERENCE section with jazz musician analogy.
- Two-step process outlined: Design Philosophy Creation header and INPUT description at beginning.
- Redundancy avoidance appears once in CRITICAL GUIDELINES but emphasized as important principle.
- Examples section provides five condensed philosophies: Concrete Poetry, Chromatic Language, Analog Meditation, Organic Systems.
- Non-overlap instruction repeated twice: once in Canvas Creation, again emphasized as non-negotiable.
- Museum quality mentioned in: Canvas Creation introduction and FINAL STEP user quote.
- Generic philosophy instruction appears once in Essential Principles but critical for reusability.
- Scientific visual language borrowed from single paragraph in Canvas Creation about systematic observation.
- Multi-page storytelling described only in MULTI-PAGE OPTION section at document end.

# ANALYSIS

The instructions obsessively emphasize craftsmanship and visual-over-textual communication, creating a framework where design philosophies generate abstract art with embedded conceptual depth that rewards expert execution and sustained viewing.

# BEST 5

- **Craftsmanship emphasized repeatedly throughout**: The instruction to make work appear "meticulously crafted" and "countless hours" appears 6+ times across sections, indicating this is the paramount quality concern above all aesthetic choices or technical execution.
- **Text minimalism as non-negotiable principle**: Mentioned in three major sections (Essential Principles, Canvas Creation, contextual element), this pattern reveals text is treated as visual accent, never primary communication method in this framework.
- **Subtle conceptual references over literal representation**: The DEDUCING section's jazz musician analogy and emphasis on "niche references embedded conceptually" shows sophistication through restraint, where knowledgeable viewers discover depth others simply appreciate aesthetically.
- **Nothing overlaps, margins are non-negotiable**: Repeated twice with "non-negotiable" language, this technical requirement reveals that professional execution means perfect spatial control, distinguishing expert work from amateur attempts regardless of aesthetic philosophy.
- **Two-step process separates philosophy from execution**: The framework explicitly divides creation into philosophy writing then visual expression, allowing one Claude to establish aesthetic worldview while another interprets it, creating collaborative depth.

# ADVICE FOR BUILDERS

- Emphasize craftsmanship quality repeatedly in prompts; single mentions get ignored by models.
- Create two-step processes where philosophy generation precedes execution for deeper creative output.
- Build constraints that reward sustained viewing through layered conceptual depth, not surface decoration.
- Make technical requirements non-negotiable; use explicit language like "this is non-negotiable" for critical standards.
- Provide condensed examples alongside full instructions to show range without constraining creative freedom.
- Separate aesthetic philosophy from subject matter to enable reusable design system applications.
- Use negative space and margins as quality indicators; overlap signals amateur execution immediately.
- Frame text as visual element first, communication tool second for sophisticated design outputs.
- Build reference systems that work on multiple levels for different audience knowledge depths.
- Emphasize refinement of existing elements over addition of new ones in revision processes.
- Use analogies from other creative fields (jazz, architecture) to communicate sophisticated concepts.
- Make sophistication non-negotiable regardless of subject matter; avoid cartoonish or amateur aesthetics always.
- Create explicit second-pass refinement steps to ensure quality meets professional museum standards.
- Provide specific technical constraints (file formats, page counts) alongside broad creative freedom.
- Build systems where context guides execution while maintaining consistent quality standards throughout.
