# PATTERNS

- Algorithmic philosophy must be created first, then expressed through code implementation
- Seeded randomness ensures reproducibility - same seed always produces identical output
- Parameters should emerge naturally from the philosophy, not from pattern menus
- Template viewer.html is mandatory starting point, not optional inspiration or reference
- Craftsmanship emphasis repeated multiple times throughout - "meticulously crafted," "master-level"
- Single self-contained HTML artifact contains everything - no external files needed
- Fixed UI elements include seed navigation, Anthropic branding, layout structure
- Variable elements are the algorithm, parameters, and parameter-specific UI controls
- Philosophy should be 4-6 paragraphs describing computational aesthetic movement
- Conceptual seed is subtle reference embedded within algorithm, not literal translation
- Process over product - beauty emerges from algorithm execution, not static frames
- Parameters control system qualities: quantities, scales, probabilities, ratios, angles, thresholds
- Color controls are optional based on artwork needs, not mandatory
- Philosophy examples show diverse approaches: flow fields, particle systems, recursion, tessellation
- Avoid redundancy in philosophy - mention each algorithmic aspect once
- Algorithm flows from philosophy, not from choosing patterns from menu
- P5.js loaded from CDN, ensuring artifact works immediately anywhere
- Seed navigation allows exploration without creating multiple files
- Implementation must balance complexity without noise, order without rigidity
- Philosophy guides what to build, not which pattern to select

# ANALYSIS

The document establishes a rigorous two-phase workflow where computational philosophy precedes implementation, emphasizing master-level craftsmanship through repeated insistence on meticulous refinement, while mandating template-based structure for consistency and algorithmic creativity for uniqueness.

# BEST 5

- **Template as mandatory starting point**: Mentioned 8+ times with escalating urgency ("CRITICAL," "STEP 0," "literal starting point"), indicating past issues with implementations ignoring provided structure, requiring self-contained artifacts that work immediately in any browser without setup.

- **Philosophy-first methodology**: Explicitly structured as two-phase process appearing in identity, workflow, and creative sections, ensuring algorithmic thinking precedes coding decisions, preventing pattern-menu thinking and encouraging original computational aesthetics rooted in conceptual frameworks.

- **Craftsmanship emphasis repeated 6+ times**: Unusual repetition of "meticulously crafted," "master-level," "countless iterations" suggests past outputs lacked refinement, requiring explicit framing that algorithms should appear professionally developed by experts at top of field.

- **Fixed vs variable architecture**: Clear separation between unchangeable Anthropic branding/seed navigation and customizable algorithm/parameters appears throughout template instructions, enabling consistent user experience while allowing infinite creative expression within defined boundaries.

- **Seeded reproducibility pattern**: Art Blocks-style approach ensures same seed produces identical output, mentioned in technical requirements and examples, enabling exploration, sharing, and variation discovery while maintaining algorithmic integrity and professional gallery-quality presentation standards.

# ADVICE FOR BUILDERS

- Always create algorithmic philosophy before coding to ensure conceptual coherence drives implementation
- Use seeded randomness for reproducibility - collectors value deterministic generative outputs
- Build self-contained artifacts requiring zero setup for immediate user engagement anywhere
- Separate fixed branding/UX from variable creative elements for scalable platform consistency
- Emphasize craftsmanship quality signals - users perceive value in "meticulously refined" framing
- Design parameters emerging from system properties, not arbitrary pattern selections
- Template compliance prevents technical debt from inconsistent implementation approaches across team
- Subtle conceptual references create depth without alienating uninformed viewers or users
- Single-file artifacts reduce deployment complexity and increase shareability for viral growth
- Balance complexity and clarity - sophisticated algorithms with intuitive parameter exploration interfaces
- Process-focused positioning differentiates from static art - emphasize living algorithmic beauty
- Parameter quantity matters less than meaningful control over emergent system behaviors
- Optional features based on artwork needs prevent feature bloat in minimal interfaces
- Seed navigation enables exploration without file proliferation, reducing storage and bandwidth
- Philosophy-driven development prevents generic outputs, establishing unique artistic voice and differentiation
